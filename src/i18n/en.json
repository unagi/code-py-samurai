      },
      "2": {
        "description": "It is too dark to see anything, but you smell sludge nearby.",
        "tip": "Use warrior.feel() to see what is in front. If it is None, walk; otherwise attack. Remember, you can only do one action per turn.",
        "clue": "Add an if/else condition with `space = warrior.feel()` and `if space is None:` to decide whether to warrior.attack() or warrior.walk()."

        "description": "The air feels thicker than before. There must be a horde of sludge.",

        "clue": "Set prev_hp = warrior.hp at the end of each turn. If warrior.hp dropped since last turn then you're taking damage and should not rest."
      },
      "5": {
        "description": "You hear cries for help. Captives must need rescuing.",

      "7": {
        "description": "You feel a wall right in front of you and an opening behind you.",

        "description": "Another large room, but with several enemies blocking your way to the stairs.",
        "tip": "Just like walking, you can attack and feel in multiple directions (forward, left, right, backward).",
        "clue": "Call warrior.feel(direction).is_enemy() in each direction to make sure there isn't an enemy beside you (attack if there is). Call warrior.rest() if you're low on health when there are no enemies around."

      "3": {
        "description": "You feel slime on all sides, you're surrounded!",
        "tip": "Call warrior.bind(direction) to bind an enemy to keep him from attacking. Bound enemies look like captives.",

        "description": "You can feel the stairs right next to you, but are you sure you want to go up them right away?",
        "tip": "You'll get more points for clearing the level first. Don't rush to stairs. Prioritize nearby units first, then head toward stairs with warrior.direction_of_stairs().",

      "7": {
        "description": "Another ticking sound, but some sludge is blocking the way.",
        "tip": "Quickly kill the sludge and rescue the captive before the bomb goes off. You can't simply go around them.",
        "clue": "Determine the direction of the ticking captive and kill any enemies blocking that path. You may need to bind surrounding enemies first."
      },
      "8": {
        "description": "You discover a satchel of bombs which will help when facing a mob of enemies.",
        "tip": "Detonate a bomb when you see a couple enemies ahead of you (warrior.look()). Watch out for your health too.",
        "clue": "Calling warrior.look() will return an array of Spaces. If the first two contain enemies, detonate a bomb with warrior.detonate()."
      },
      "9": {
        "description": "Never before have you seen a room so full of sludge. Start the fireworks!",
        "tip": "Be careful not to let the ticking captive get caught in the flames. Use warrior.distance_of to avoid the captives.",
        "clue": "Be sure to bind the surrounding enemies before fighting. Check your health before detonating explosives."
